# Challege Definition ðŸ”Ž

I have a legacy app and I tried to demonstrate setup and objects in this sample project. Basically this app contains a list view that shows ads to customers. As a iOS developer I have been asked to create a new cell (TableViewCell) with different designs to show ads and we need below specs to implement this new cells.

## Specs âœ…
 - [ ] This new cell should be in a separate module.
 - [ ] We should keep the old implementation to run an experiment and find out does our customer like new design or not. 
 - [ ] We want to refactor the code as much as possible during this task.

## My Challenges ðŸŽ‘

 - How to design boundaries of this new module so we are sure that we implemented all best practices.
 - How to reflect our current design and solution we came up with in diagrams.
